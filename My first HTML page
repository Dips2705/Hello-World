      My Family
    </h3>
    <p>
    My father's name is Kalidas Ganguly. He is a retired private school teacher. He teaches Physics and Mathematics. He is my friend, philosopher and guide. He is the reason I am invested in Science.

      My mother's name is Supriti Ganguly. She is a homemaker of profound talents. Quite literally, she is the superwoman of our household. She is the best mother one can ever hope to have.

      I have an elder brother. His name is Sagnik Ganguly. He works in a MNC in Gujarat. He is 25 years old and has always been a strict yet loving guardian. While on one hand, I can easily talk to him about sports stuff, on the other he also maintains a note on my studies and gives me valuable tips.
